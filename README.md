FuseOne 3D printer
==========================
FuseOne is another 3D printer based in Fused Filament Fabrication technology.

With a first working prototype made as my Final Year Project for BEng (Hons) Mechatronics in Staffordshire University and Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering in Universidad Europea de Madrid, I have decided to redesign it from scratch to make an even better 3D printer.

Quick Information
===================
This printer is inspired in RepRap project. I'm trying to design the printer as self-replicating as possible.


Current features:
=========
*   MicroSD
*   CoreXY/H-Bot kinematics
*   Graphical display for autonomous printing (Optional)

Future features:
=========
*   Dual extruder
*   Lot more features... Still thinking on it

#Some great sources used in this project:


*   LionHeart electronics (http://reprap.org/wiki/SAV_MKI)
*   CoreXY kinematics (http://corexy.com/)
*   Marlin firmware (https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin)

##Thanks a lot to:
*   Brice Espinasse, for his help at the beginning with Creo Parametric.
*   [fmalpartida](https://github.com/fmalpartida), for his wonderful [SAV MkI](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/SAV_MKI) and all the help configuring the electronics.
*   Leon3D, for their support and their really awesome prices that make me possible to develop this prototype.
*   [CloneWars project](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Proyecto_Clone_Wars), for their innumerable times helping me with all the problems during the project, especially to that magic Hangout group.

(I want this to be a really long list, so if you feel that your name should be here and you don't see it, tell me!!)
