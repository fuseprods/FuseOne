FuseOne 3D printer
==========================
FuseOne 3D printer is my Final Year Project for BEng (Hons) Mechatronics in Staffordshire University and Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering in Universidad Europea de Madrid.

Quick Information
===================
This printer is inspired in RepRap project. I'm trying to design the printer as self-replicating as possible.


Current features:
=========
*   USB host
*   MicroSD
*   CoreXY

Desired features:
=========
*   Dual extruder
*   Graphical display for autonomous printing
*   Lot more features... Still thinking on it

Software used in this project
=========

*   Creo 2.0 for parametric design of the printer.
*   Eagle for electronic schematics and board.

(I hope to rebuild the project with open source software some day)
