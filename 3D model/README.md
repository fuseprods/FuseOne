FuseOne 3D printer - CAD files
==========================

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.


This printer is being designed with Creo 2.0, but I will work in a .scad version of the pieces to give you the possibility to customize and improve the project.


I will upload .STL files as soon as I try the models. 

The .PART files will be uploaded approximately in May*, after the presentation of the project in the university.

I hope to finish the .SCAD files during this summer.

*Lot of factors may modify this date, but I will try to give you all the sources as soon as possible.

I have uploaded the files without testing due to some problems with the original storage of all the files (OK, I have lost my flash drive). Some of the files are not mine and are not referenced yet. Here you will find soon a list with all the files I am using and the original sources of all of them.

Give me a couple of days to generate all the STL files and feel free to clone or fork this project!
