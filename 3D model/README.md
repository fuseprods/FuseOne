FuseOne 3D printer - CAD files
==========================

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.


This printer has being designed with Creo 2.0 Academic version, but I will work in a .scad version of the pieces to give you the possibility to customize and improve the project even if you don't have access to this software.

The [.STL](../STL) files have been generated for Stratasys ABS. Please, print some small piece at the beginning to be sure that the holes are in a good scale for you printing settings (this depends on the thermal expansion coefficient of your material). I suppose that should work for everyone but if not, tell me!!

I hope to port the design to .SCAD during this summer.

Some of the assembly pieces come from part libraries or another authors, here you have the references:

I'm actually using 624ZZ bearings and I'm using this file only in the assembly simulation, take a look of the BOM before pursaching the wrong parts!!
